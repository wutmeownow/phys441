#
#  Viper: A competative variant of Snake 
#
#  Goal: Be the last snake standing in each round.
#
#  Scoring: Each time a snake crashes all of the snakes that have not yet
#           crashed are awarded 1 point.
#
#  Game End: The game ends at the end of the round in which one or more players
#            reach 10 points.  The player with the highest score is the winner.
#            Ties can occur.
#
#  Future Work: Right now the AI identifies the direction it should head 
#               by looking for the longest distance to a collision.  But it
#               doesn't check to see if it is possible to turn from its
#               current heading to the heading that has the longest distance
#               without colliding with anything.  It would be better if the
#               AI identified its direction based on the longest distance to 
#               a collision that can actually be reached based on its turning
#               radius (which is based on its speed).
