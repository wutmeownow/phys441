    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will use measured concentrations of insulin to simulate the glucose-insulin system, and compare the results to measured concentrations of glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you'll have a chance to implement the second part of the model, which uses measured concentrations of glucose to simulate the insulin response, and compare the results to the data."
