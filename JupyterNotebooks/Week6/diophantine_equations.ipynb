    "# Diophantine equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Diophantus was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3rd century.  He is known for his book *Arithmetica*, which contains a collection of problems, some of which are now known as Diophantine equations.  A Diophantine equation is an equation where the solutions are required to be integers.  For example, consider the following Diophantine equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Pythagorean equation, and has solutions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ that are integers.  For example, $x=3$, $y=4$, and $z=5$ is a solution to this equation.  In fact, there are an infinite number of solutions to this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of examples in real life where we want to find integer solutions to equations.  For example, consider the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A farmer has 100 animals consisting of chickens and pigs.  The farmer counts 280 legs.  How many chickens and pigs does the farmer have?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *Source: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/systems-linear-equations-matrices.html*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this problem using the following system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c + p = 100$$\n",
    "$$2c + 4p = 280$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ is the number of chickens and $p$ is the number of pigs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical solution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c + p = 100$$\n",
    "$$c = 100 - p$$\n",
    "$$2(100 - p) + 4p = 280$$\n",
    "$$200 - 2p + 4p = 280$$\n",
    "$$2p = 80$$\n",
    "$$p = 40$$\n",
    "$$c = 100 - 40 = 60$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the farmer has 60 chickens and 40 pigs.  This is a really simple example, of course.  But, there are many real world problems that can be solved using Diophantine equations where the system is not so simple, and in particular where there are more than 2 variables, more than 2 equations, and where the equations are not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is for these complicated systems where a numerical solution is useful.  In this notebook, we will explore how to solve Diophantine equations first analyticaly, and then numerically using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Another Diophantine equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 1$$\n",
    "$$y + z - x = 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to find all integer solutions to this system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this system of equations analytically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, isolate $y$ and $z$ in both equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y + z = x + 3$$\n",
    "$$y^2 + z^2 = x^2 - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, square the first equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(y + z)^2 = (x + 3)^2$$\n",
    "$$y^2 + z^2 + 2yz = x^2 + 6x + 9$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtract the second equation from this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2yz = 6x + 10$$\n",
    "$$yz = 3x + 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$yz = 3x + 5$$\n",
    "$$y + z = x - 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following quadratic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t^2 - (y + z)t + yz = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This has solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{y + z \\pm \\sqrt{(y + z)^2 - 4yz}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{y + z \\pm \\sqrt{y^2+z^2+2yz-4yz}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{y + z \\pm \\sqrt{y^2+z^2-2yz}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{y+z \\pm (y-z)}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = y, z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using the expression for $(y+z)$ and $yz$ above, it also has solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{x + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{(x + 3)^2 - 4(3x + 5)}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{x + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 + 6x + 9 - 12x - 20}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{x + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 6x - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking for integer solutions, we can set the discriminant to be a perfect square:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2 - 6x - 11 = n^2$$\n",
    "$$x^2 - 6x + 9 -20 = n^2$$\n",
    "$$(x - 3)^2 - 20 = n^2$$\n",
    "$$(x - 3)^2 - n^2 = 20$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is $another$ Diophantine equation!  So, this problem is a Diophantine equation inside a Diophantine equation. We can solve this new equation by factoring the left hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(x - 3 + n)(x - 3 - n) = 20$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now consider all possible factorizations of 20:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$20 = 1 \\times 20$$\n",
    "$$20 = 2 \\times 10$$\n",
    "$$20 = 4 \\times 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and also the negative versions of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$20 = -1 \\times -20$$\n",
    "$$20 = -2 \\times -10$$\n",
    "$$20 = -4 \\times -5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now solve for $x$ in each of these cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x - 3 + n = 20$$\n",
    "$$x - 3 - n = 1$$\n",
    "$$2x-6 = 21$$\n",
    "$$x = 13.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, NOT an integer solution!  It turns out the other cases where the factors add up to ODD numbers also do not yield integer solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the cases where the factors add up to EVEN numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x - 3 + n = 10$$\n",
    "$$x - 3 - n = 2$$\n",
    "$$2x-6 = 12$$\n",
    "$$x = 9$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x - 3 + n = -10$$\n",
    "$$x - 3 - n = -2$$\n",
    "$$2x-6 = -12$$\n",
    "$$x = -3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $x=9$ this back into the original equations, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{x + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 6x - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{9 + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{9^2 - 6(9) - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 54 - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = 8, 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $x=-3$ back into the original equations, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{x + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 6x - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{-3 + 3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 6(-3) - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{0 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 18 - 11}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{0 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2}$$\n",
    "$$t = 2, -2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have the following solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 9, y = 8, z = 4$$\n",
    "$$x = 9, y = 4, z = 8$$\n",
    "$$x = -3, y = 2, z = -2$$\n",
    "$$x = -3, y = -2, z = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check these solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 1$$\n",
    "$$9^2 - 8^2 - 4^2 = 81 - 64 - 16 = 1$$\n",
    "$$9^2 - 4^2 - 8^2 = 81 - 16 - 64 = 1$$\n",
    "$$(-3)^2 - 2^2 - (-2)^2 = 9 - 4 - 4 = 1$$\n",
    "$$(-3)^2 - (-2)^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 - 4 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y + z - x = 3$$\n",
    "$$8 + 4 - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3$$\n",
    "$$4 + 8 - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3$$\n",
    "$$2 - 2 - (-3) = 3$$\n",
    "$$-2 + 2 - (-3) = 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, these are indeed solutions to the system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical solution\n",
